Using MVC architecture in .NET 5.0 a simple website was created which allows users to select a file from their system and upload it to an Azure Blob Storage account.

It also logs all instances of files uploaded to a database.

In this case I created my own account in Azure and uploaded documents from my device to it via this service.
